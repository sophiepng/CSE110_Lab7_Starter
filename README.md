1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
- Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. Through these automated tests, any incremental code developments are checked each time to ensure that no enhancement or bug fix breaks the code. This prevents any pushed code from taking down the program/application.

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? 
- No because end to end tests are for complete user workflows for the entire application, and would not be as clear as unit tests for checking function outputs

3) What is the difference between navigation and snapshot mode?
- Navigation mode analyzes a page right after it loads while snapshot mode analyzes a page in its current state. Navigation mode gives an overall performance metric, with no change analyses. Snapshot mode is good for accessibility issues.

4) Name three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results.
- Properly size images to save around 518 KiB
- Serve images in next-gen formats to save around 165 KiB
- Preconnect to required origins to save around 60 ms
